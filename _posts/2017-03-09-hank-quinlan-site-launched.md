I finally created my page. This blog will be used for bunch of stuff. Here I will post multiple things: 
+ Weekly music I liked in the form of youtube links and videos.
+ My views about people in general.
+ My views about Church and religion.
+ My progress with my [plugin](https://github.com/xcegin/PUTVT) for github.
+ New things for Java Developers.
+ Aaaand more. :smile:

I have a lot of work to do during school time, but I will try to be as active as possible. Hopefully a few people will like this :smile:.

So looking forward to see you around!
